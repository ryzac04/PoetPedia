# PoetPedia

PoetPedia is a free, easy-to-use website to read poems accessed through an API called PoetryDB. Searches can be done by poem title, poem line content, or by authors.

If a user wishes, an account can be made - the main benefit of this being that poems can then be favorited by clicking on the now-visible bookmark on the poem's page. These poems will then be added to the user's Poetry Book in a list of favorites!

The goal of this simple website is to make access to a large body of poetry as easy as possible.
